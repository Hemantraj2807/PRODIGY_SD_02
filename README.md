# PRODIGY_SD_02
Aim of the programm is to build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. It is designed in such a way that it prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It will continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.
